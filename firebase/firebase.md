# Firebase

1. Firebase main (console) page is `https://console.firebase.google.com/` go to it and create a `project`

- A `project` in Firebase is a container for our app. It lets us share data and analytics across platforms (e.g., Android, iOS, and web) so users have the same experience regardless of the device theyâ€™re on.

2. Navigate to the Cloud Firestore page by clicking its icon on left sidebar

3. Create a database by clicking Create Database button on Firebase's `Cloud Firestore` page

- Choose `Start in test mode` and click Next. Then, on the next screen, click `Enable`. Once these steps have been completed, an empty database will be created for us.

4. create a `collection` . Let's call it `users` to keep records of users.

## On React app side:

1. To integrate Firebase into our React app, we need to first get the web configuration object from ```Get started by adding Firebase to your app" ( select </> for we app) and then use it to initialize Firebase in our react app.

2. In React project install Firebase using `npm i firebase`
3. In React project create a file called ``firebase.js` (in same directory as App.js).

```js
import firebase from "firebase/compat/app";
import "firebase/compat/auth";
import "firebase/compat/firestore";
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "API_KEY",
  authDomain: "AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "APP_ID",
};
firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const db = firebase.firestore();

export default db;
```

- Note that the firebaseConfig should be replaced by the firebaseConfig object from your Firebase project
