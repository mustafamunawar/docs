Reading through the four gospels, I get the understanding that Jesus(pbuh) unequivocally declared that he came to fulfill the law (the Mosaic law) and that the law is to remain intact even heaven and earth pass away:   

Matthew 5:17
“Do not presume that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.

Matthew 5:18
For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke of a letter shall pass from the Law, until all is accomplished!

Luke 16:17
But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the Law to fail.

Jesus(pbuh) even used an example from the law to defend his healing of a man on Sabbath: 
John 7:23
If a man receives circumcision on a Sabbath so that the Law of Moses will not be broken, are you angry at Me because I made an entire man well on a Sabbath?

When they were planning to crucify him, he reminded them of the law of Moses:
John 7:19
“Did Moses not give you the Law, and yet none of you carries out the Law? Why are you seeking to kill Me?”

However, Jesus always criticized how partially and wickedly the law was implemented:
Matthew 23:23
“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier provisions of the Law: justice and mercy and faithfulness; but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others.

In summary according to four gospels, Jesus(pbuh) totally respected "the law", never condemned or cursed it but, yes, he zealouly criticized the way it was practiced by Jew pharisees.

Is my understanding about this matter is correct? 






John 1:17
For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.

Luke 16:16
“The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John came; since that time the gospel of the kingdom of God has been preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.

John 7:19
“Did Moses not give you the Law, and yet none of you carries out the Law? Why are you seeking to kill Me?”

John 7:23
If a man receives circumcision on a Sabbath so that the Law of Moses will not be broken, are you angry at Me because I made an entire man well on a Sabbath?

Acts 24:14
But I confess this to you, that in accordance with the Way, which they call a sect, I do serve the God of our fathers, believing everything that is in accordance with the Law and is written in the Prophets;

Luke 24:44
Now He said to them, “These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all the things that are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.”

John 7:19
“Did Moses not give you the Law, and yet none of you carries out the Law? Why are you seeking to kill Me?”

John 7:49
But this crowd that does not know the Law is accursed!”
