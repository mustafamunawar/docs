# CSS Notes

- The selector `.name1.name2` means a div or an element having both classes together, for example:

`<div class="name1 name2">...</div>`

- On the other hand the selector `.name1 .name2` means a div or an element which has a class name1 and any of its child nodes having class name2

```html
<div class="name1">
  <div class="name2">...</div>
</div>
```
