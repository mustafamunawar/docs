# Zoom Notes

- The `Zoom web client` allows joining a Zoom meeting or webinar in a web browser without downloading any plugins or software. The web client can help users who are limited in what they can install or download, allowing them to use their web browser and join Zoom meetings without downloading the application. By default, participants joining through the web client do not need to be signed in to a Zoom account, but the host can require authentication.

- Through your settings, you can control if the `Join From Browser` link appears automatically or if it only appears once the participants attempt to download the Zoom client.

- The web client has limited features and functions best on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Chromium Edge. See a detailed list of features available in the web client. Currently, panelists can not join a webinar practice session from the web client.
