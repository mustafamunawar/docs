# ELearning Authoring Tools

- An authoring tool is software that enables you to create and arrange content into a standardized course structure. This structure can then be exported in several different multimedia types.

For those in eLearning, the most common output is to the SCORM format. LMSs, like LearnUpon, are compatible with SCORM 1.2 (yup, there are multiple versions). With LMS authoring tools, you get a handy zip package that easily uploads to your SCORM compliant LMS.
